OAuth Examples using Yahoo Social APIs

These standalone scripts are meant to be run from the command line,
for learning the OAuth requests and responses.  You are expectd to
edit these scripts (very minimally) to fill in the various tokens and
secrets required as input for each step.

The accompanying tutorial can be found here:

globals.php - edit to fill in the consumer key and secret
getreqtok.php - no editing required
getacctok.php - edit to fill in the required 3 pieces of information
refacctok.php - edit to fill in the required 3 pieces of information
callcontact.php - edit to fill in the required token and secret

Though the concepts are generic to OAuth, these scripts have been
tweaked to work with Yahoo's Social APIs.
